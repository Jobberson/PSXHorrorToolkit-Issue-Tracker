### Feature Request for PSX Horror Toolkit

**What module do you want to suggest a feature to?**  
Ex. Interaction System  
_Example: "Lighting System"_

---

**Is your feature request related to a problem or limitation in the toolkit? Please describe.**  
Explain what you're trying to achieve and what limitations you're currently facing.  
_Example: "I want to add a flashlight to my game, but the toolkit doesn't currently include a built-in flashlight system that works with the retro lighting style."_  

---

**Describe the feature you'd like to see added**  
Be as specific as possible. What should the feature do? How would it integrate with existing systems?  
_Example: "A flashlight prefab that casts a cone of light using the PSX-style lighting, with optional flickering and battery drain. It should be easy to attach to the player and toggle with a key press."_  

---

**How would this improve retro horror game development?**  
Describe how this feature would help developers using the toolkit.  
_Example: "A flashlight system would make dark environments more immersive and interactive, helping developers create tension and guide players through scenes."_  

---

**Have you considered any alternatives or workarounds?**  
If you've tried other solutions, mention them here.  
_Example: "I tried using Unityâ€™s default spotlight, but it doesnâ€™t match the retro aesthetic and doesnâ€™t integrate well with the toolkitâ€™s lighting system."_  

---

**Additional context or references**  
Include screenshots, mockups, links to similar systems, or anything that helps illustrate your idea.  
_Example: "Here's a video showing the kind of flashlight effect Iâ€™m aiming for: [YouTube link]"_
